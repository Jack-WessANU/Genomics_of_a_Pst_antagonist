# This is a short description of the code I used to call the POLCA polishing tool on the 4 Medaka polished assemblies of the PenX genome. 

# Polca is a software package designed to use short read Illumina data to polish nanopore assemblies


# polca.sh calls the polca software
# -a denotes the assembly input
# -r denotes the input reads
# -t denotes the number of threads to include

# both assemblies are called consensus.fasta as they are from the Medaka output. 

# I made separate folders for the Canu and Flye, each containing their respective 10kb12Q and 10kb8Q assemblies and ran a script with contents:

# Then from inside the 10kb12Q folder:

polca.sh -a consensus.fasta -r '../../PenX_R1_combined.fastq ../../PenX_R2_combined.fastq' -t 60

##Change directory to 10kb8Q for its run of polca polishing.

cd ../10kb8Q

## Secondly, run a polca polish on the assembly for 10kb8Q.

polca.sh -a consensus.fasta -r '../../PenX_R1_combined.fastq ../../PenX_R2_combined.fastq' -t 60
